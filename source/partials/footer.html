          Zapzal is a software platform exclusively designed for facilitating cryptocurrency transactions and does not perform any independent due diligence or in-depth examination of blockchain assets, digital currencies, cryptocurrencies, or associated funds.The full and sole responsibility for evaluating your investments, determining whether to engage in blockchain asset swaps, and making decisions related to these swaps on the Zapzal website lies with you. It's important to recognize that the value of blockchain assets can be volatile, and past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results. Investing in blockchain assets carries the inherent risk of partial or total loss of your investment, as the value of these assets is subject to market fluctuations and other investment-related risks. Furthermore, Zapzal users are accountable for securely storing their recovery phrase. Losing the recovery phrase may result in the inability to retrieve private keys and access their cryptocurrency holdings.
